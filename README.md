# Restaurant Review App
---

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Review App** project, I was instructed to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In the first stage, we took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We then also addded a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.
After structuring everything nicely with a responsive and ergonomic design, I now have a "Review" application that's ready for deployment and use.
### Project Rubric

### CRITERIA

* Is the site UI compatible with a range of display sizes?

* All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes.

* Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes.

* An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.

* Are images responsive?

* Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the browser, regardless of viewport size.

* Are application elements visible and usable in all viewports?

* On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports. The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.

#### Are images accessible?

* All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.

* Is focus used appropriately to allow easy navigation of the site?

* Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.

* Are site elements defined semantically?

* Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.

### Offline Availability

* Are pages that have been visited available offline?

* When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
